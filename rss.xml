            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>a rather short history of (believable) CG characters in movies</h1><p>UPDATE 05/28/2012: exchanged source video for 720p version, no big changes to the content, only small corrections to framing (4:3 --16:9), audio cleanup and 2 or 3 small changes to the edit. due to the 500MB upload limit for free members the bitrate is still rather low at 3200, so don't expect a massive quality boost....</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a3855dd4780ab3a8cd165567128a94f0961dc256.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Create a Customer Journey Map -</h1><p>Despite best intentions and mountains of data, many organizations continue to offer lackluster experiences for their customers.

Every interaction a customer has with an organization has an effect on satisfaction, loyalty, and the bottom line.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e91b63f25233ac6642a58a42c8bb0c21ac878c4e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Seven Rare Steve Jobs Videos That Show How To "Think Different"</h1><p>This video shows rare footage of Steve Jobs from 1980 giving a talk about starting Apple. What's particularly striking is Jobs's explanation of man's skill as a toolmaker to amplify his inherent ability, which he says is why Apple was formed: not as many other companies were-to create a product-but instead to create tools that enhance man's innate talents.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a48c54483d824d0b2371efa2f56483c1c03c5e2a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
