      Companies have a bad habit of treating customers like a flakey guy would
      treat a girl he didn't care about. Once they have the customer, they don't

      mis-read me; you are in a relationship with your customers.

  Despite best intentions and mountains of data, many organizations continue to
  offer lackluster experiences for their customers. Many organizations function

  their various products, services and employees. Every interaction a customer
  has with an organization has an effect on satisfaction, loyalty, and the
  bottom line.
