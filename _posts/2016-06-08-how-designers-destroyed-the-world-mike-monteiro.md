  Designers have a responsibility, not only to themselves and to their clients,
  but also to the wider world. We are designers because we love to create, but
  creation without responsibility breeds destruction. Every day, designers all
  over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to
  the impact that work has on the world around them.
