  There's no learning without mistakes. And I've done the following (as well as
  seen the following done) too many times to count. Luckily, there's this thing
  called the "Internet" and this medium called an "article" that lets us point
  at and talk about mistakes behind their backs, in the hopes that by bullying
  them into the spotlight, they'll have a harder time slinking around, wasting
  our time, and steering us toward no-good solutions.
