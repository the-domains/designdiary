      Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a
      firmly rooted tongue in cheek. If you believed every How To Manage
      self-help book, you'd think the only way to succeed as a boss is to be

  This video shows rare footage of Steve Jobs from 1980 giving a talk about

  Apple was formed: not as many other companies were-to create a product-but
  instead to create tools that enhance man's innate talents.
